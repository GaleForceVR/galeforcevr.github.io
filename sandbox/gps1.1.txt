Pair Programming

<p>When a potential boot first starts to delve into the Dev Bootcamp experience one thing becomes abundantly clear almost instantly. One of the core skills developed at DBC is Peer Pairing. Offering major advantages in quality of code, sharing of ideas and onboarding of new programmers it is easy to see why Pair Programming is become one of the hottest issues in Web Development.</p>
<p>Clearly, Pair Programming is one of the most important skills that DBC teaches. Here is a look at four of the reasons that Pair Programming is so important:</p>
<li><p>Pair programming is increasingly common in software development in general and pretty standard for ruby on rails jobs
and likely to be part of the interview process.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhances learning experience
Knowlegde is constantly shared between pair programmers, from tips on rules to design. Gives the oppertunity for one pair to examine the others code and provide feedback which is needed to increase their own abilities to develop.</p></li>
<li><p>Increases quality of code - less bugs
Pairing partners are less likely to go down in the rabbit hole, and tend to come up with better designs.
<li><p>Promotes sharing of ideas
Everone has different minds that think in very different ways. Everyone also codes in different ways. Pair programming allows for, at a minimun, two ideas. This goes along with the idea that it enhances learning.</p></li>
<p>Pair Programming is a way of writing code with two people working on the same document. One person types and is typically called the "Driver." The other person is called the "Navigator."</p>
<p>Although the terms can mean different things to different programmers, typically the Navigator will instruct the Driver which line of code to work on next and watch for errors in the code.</p>
<p>The driver usually goes where the Navigator says and is not to work on any other line of code. The Driver is not to make any changes to the code without discussing with the Navigator first. In most pairs, the Driver and Navigator will switch roles from time to time. If both programmers are equal in knowledge and skill, they will typically split the time in the two roles about 50/50.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure. If you attend Dev Bootcamp, you are going to learn how to be a good Pair Programmer. With all of the benefits Pair Programming brings to the table, it is easy to see why it is spreading so quickly in the development community. DBC will likely continue to focus on Pair Programming as a main component of it's disruptive educational system well into the future.</p>
