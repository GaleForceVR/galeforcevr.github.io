							<h3 class="sub-headline">My take on the Dev Bootcamp experience as Phase 0 Week 1 wraps up</h3>

							<!-- main story -->
							<p>I just watched Shereef Bishay in the famous "Fireside Chat" video. I am so pumped up right now, I might code for 8 more hours straight. It's 7:15pm now, so I don't know where that puts me. I'll let you do the math, 'cause I've got more important Rubyish type things to think about.</p>
							<p>All kidding aside, I really am excited right now. I'm tired and a bit frazzled from all of the new knowledge that is swimming around in my head. It feels really good. At times this week it has felt a bit overwhelming, and I know it has been even worse for some fellow members of my cohort.</p>
							<p><!-- <div class="article-img-right"><img src="../images/billabong-dusty-thmb.jpg" alt="Billabong the hangtag has a new peer pairing partner named Dusty."><p class="article-img-caption">INLINE THUMBNAIL CAPTION</p></div> --><em><strong>What is my impression of DBC?</strong></em> I see DBC as an institution that thinks the same way I think as an individual. I don't like to do big things. I like to do <em><strong>EPIC</strong></em> things! I think if I embark on something epic, DBC and everyone associated with it will be right there with me, or at least cheering me on.</p>
							<p>DBC is not concerned with doing what is expected. Rather it is concerned with doing the best that is possible within the bounds of time and energy.</p>

							<p>I'm serious, because I've been looking for opportunities like this for twenty years. I've never seen anything like it.</p>
							<p><em><strong>How do I see myself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></em> I can't wait. It's almost as if DBC was made for me, or I was made for DBC. I have a high capacity for learning a huge amount of information in a short time, and this is exactly how I prefer to learn things.</p>
							<p>It's not just DBC the building, faculty and curriculum. In a very big way, it's the cohort.</p>
							<p>I know that I am going to be spending 9 weeks of my life with some of the most engaged, passionate, brilliant, energetic and positive people that I will likely ever meet. Getting to know them all will be awesome and having the opportunity to sit and learn with them is something that I almost cannot fathom at this time. It seems surreal. I know that this will lead to amazing things in the future.</p>
							<p><em><strong>Have my expectations of DBC changed?</strong></em> Not one bit. That is all.</p>
							<p><em><strong>Am I excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</strong></em> I simply cannot express how incredible I think this opportunity is. Yes, I am ecstatic to be able to be a part of this. I've been searching for something like this for the past 20 years. It feels like an incredible dream is coming true.</p>
							<p><em><strong>Does it make me nervous?</strong></em> In a good way yes. Of the two fears that Shereef spoke of, I've experienced both at one time or another in the past week. Ultimately, I know that I will make it through. I am determined and I won't let anything stop me.</p>
							<p>Last Sunday, I wrote a <a href="http://www.blog.galevanrossem.com/dbc-prep-phase-reflections-start-week-1-phase-0/" alt="GaleVanRossem.com">blog post on my portfolio blog site</a> and I said that I felt like when I fell asleep that night I was going to enter an 18 week long dream and that when I woke up, I would have my dogtags. Here I am 5 days later, and it feels like weeks have gone by and at the same time it feels like I just went to sleep on Sunday night. I'm in the DBC time warp and I'm loving it!</p>
