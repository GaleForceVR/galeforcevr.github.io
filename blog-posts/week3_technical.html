							<h3 class="sub-headline">Often maligned, javaScript stands as an important language in Web Design and Development</h3>

							<!-- main story -->
							<p>Start a discussion on javaScript in any online community and you are likely to find many detractors. You will certainly find a great deal of heated discussion on the benefits/shortcomings of one of the most popular programming languages alive in cyberspace.</p>
							<p>If you don't walk in tech circles (or should I say you don't have anyone in your Google+ circles) you might even mistake the mention of javaScript for another popular language called Java. They are in fact completely different languages. The use of "java" at the beginning of the name was meant to be a marketing tactic, but that largely backfired as now everyone is just confused if they don't realize the two are different.</p>
							<p>The fact of the matter is that javaScript is the only major language that is supported by all major web browsers and infact was developed specifically for use in web applications. The simple fact that all browsers support it is enough to make it an extremely important language on the web.</p>
							<p>Without javaScript, websites would be largely static and boring. Designers and developers use it to add interactivity to web pages.</p>
							<p>If so many designers and developers dislike it, why do so many use it? Well, as I stated above, all of the major browsers support it and it's a relatively easy language to learn. The fact that the browsers support it coupled with the need of designers and developers to add interactivity to web pages has resulted in a snowball effect.</p>
							<p>As demand has grown, free as well as paid tutorials have sprung up at an alarming rate. The more tutorials that are available the easier it becomes to learn, even for a novice programmer with limited financial resources.</p>
							<p>Regardless of what you might think of the usefulness of javaScript as a programming language, the fact remains that it is a necessary skill for anyone who wants to create dynamic web pages at this time. In addition, Google Chrome and Firefox with Firebug offer javaScript support in their Dev Tools assortments. This adds to the snowball effect by making it even easier to develop any application that uses javaScript.</p>
							<p>Personally, I really like javaScript and look forward to see what the future brings. I see no end to the use of javaScript on the web in the near future.</p>
