							<!-- main story -->
							<p>When I visit a website, there are about 3 main things that I look for that will very quickly determine whether or not I will stay on that site.</p>
							<ol class="one-time">
								<li>How easy is it to find whatever I am looking for?</li>
								<li>How easy is it to figure out what I should do next?</li>
								<li>Is there anything about the site that is interesting enough to keep me around?</li>
							</ol>
							<p>At first glance, based on my criteria, it might seem like the visual design of the site isn't very important. After all, I didn't list the visual design of the site in my main criteria.</p>
							<p>Quite the contrary, of course. In reality, the visual design of the site is crucial in all 3 of the criteria I listed above. Graphic designers agonize over all sorts of decisions in the creative/design process to create a design which has purpose, can communicate exactly the message the site is intended to communicate, can help lead a users eyes toward the very thing they are looking for and also create a pleasing mood which reinforces a users desire to stay on the site.</p>
							<p>Good design is not just about making a site look pretty. In fact, the most important factor in creating a good design is to create a site that performs it's function first. The visually appealing images, colors and textures good designers use often stand out and catch the eye of the viewer, but they are often simply they icing on the cake from the designers point of view.</p>
							<p>That is to say that a good designer is most interested with the entire experience of the visitor. It's not enough to just have eye popping images or a visually appealing site. Can a visitor actually navigate the site without having to guess where the next item they are looking for is located? Are there too many options which can cause paralysis? If there is a lot of copy, is it readable? Are there enough visual breaks in the copy to hold a visitor's interest? etc...</p>
							<p>Good developers should keep these things in mind as well while they develop their sites. It might be beneficial for the developer to think of the visual design of the site in the same way that they think about breaking down a problem to write code for it. It is actually a very similar process.</p>
							<p>Designers try to pair down a problem and remove as many elements that are not important to the main message as is possible. A good visual design, in fact, is made up of only as many elements as is needed to communicate the main message. It is identical to the process that developers use when solving a programming challenge. </p>
							<p>Content, of course, is just as crucial as the visual design of the site, but a good visual design will help your site draw more visitors, help to satisfy your visitors while keeping them in a positive state of mine, and help keep them around longer.</p>
